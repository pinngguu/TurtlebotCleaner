Spiral cleaner and Grid cleaner included
Few things we need to know about the launch file:
  1. There are three paramaters we should know about in the <node> tab - name, pkg, type.
  2. 'name' is the name off the node we want to give. It is a custom naming method. It can be anything.
  3. 'pkg' is the name of the package in which your clean.py file is built.
  4. 'type' is the name of the actual node/file you want to run with the launch file.
